# LogScale Community Content

Welcome to the LogScale community content repo, formerly known as Humio. Here we'll include useful queries, dashboards, tutorials, etc for LogScale. These are not meant as replacements for the [official documentation](https://library.humio.com) or the [LogScale Package Marketplace](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/packages-marketplace.html).

# Wiki

The wiki contains the following guides and tutorials:

- **[Foundational Building Blocks](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/logscale-community-content/wiki/Foundational-Building-Blocks)**: this is a list of common questions we've seen in the field. If you've ever wondered how to accomplish X to get to Y, this is likely the place to start. 
 
- **[Function Samples](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/logscale-community-content/wiki/Function-Samples)**: these are examples of using a few of the common functions within LogScale. The full function documentation [can be found here](https://library.humio.com/falcon-logscale/functions.html). 

- **[Hunting and Investigations](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/logscale-community-content/wiki/Hunting-and-Investigations)**: ever wondered how to hunt through Falcon telemetry data, aka FDR? This is likely the best place to start. 

# Content

Here's a quick summary of the various folders in this repo:

- **[Log-Shippers](Log-Shippers)**: these are configuration files for varios log shippers, e.g. Falcon LogScale Collector, FluentD, Vector, etc.

- **[Misc-Content](Misc-Content)**: scripts, lookup files, etc. 

- **[Vendor-Packages](Vendor-Content)**: vendor packages used by the SE team. This is not a replacement for the [LogScale Package Marketplace](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/packages-marketplace.html). These packages tend to be much more complete than individual dashboards, queries, alerts, etc. 

- **[Vendor-Content](Vendor-Packages)**: queries, dashboards, alerts, etc grouped by vendor.
