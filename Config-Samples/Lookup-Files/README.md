##  TCP/UDP Port and Service Numbers
In TCP/IP and UDP networks, a port is an endpoint to a logical connection and the way a client program specifies a specific server program on a computer in a network. The port number identifies what type of port it is. For example, port 80 is used for HTTP traffic. 

Some ports have numbers that are assigned to them by the IANA, and these are called the “well-known ports” which are specified in RFC 1700.
