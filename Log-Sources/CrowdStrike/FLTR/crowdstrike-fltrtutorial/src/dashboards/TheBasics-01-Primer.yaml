    text: "The LogScale query language is extremely powerful. It's largely based on\
      \ open standards and the language of mathematics, and balances simplicity and\
      \ functionality to help users quickly find what they need, fast.\n\nIn this\
      \ tutorial, weâ€™ll use Falcon telemetry data to learn LogScale. The content and\
      \ concepts we will cover, however, can be adapted and reused with any dataset\
      \ that LogScale happens to be ingesting, e.g. first-party, third-party, etc.\n\
      \nWe will start with the very basics and build on the queries as we go.\n\n\
      Additional resources are available as references:\n\n- [Official documentation](https://library.humio.com/falcon-logscale/writing-queries.html):\
      \ documentation on the query language.\n\n- [LogScale Query Primer](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/logscale-community-content/wiki/LogScale-Query-Primer):\
      \ a comprehensive guide on using the LogScale query language. \n\n- [LogScale\
      \ Query Building Blocks](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/logscale-community-content/wiki/LogScale-Query-Building-Blocks):\
      \ this is a list of common questions we've seen in the field.\n\n- [LogScale\
      \ Function Addendum](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/logscale-community-content/wiki/LogScale-Function-Addendum):\
      \ these are examples of using a few of the common functions within LogScale.\
