# CrowdStrike Core FLTR Package

This package provides a robust set of queries and dashboards for use with FLTR. In addition, the majority of the content is commented to act as a tutorial and learning guide.

# Install

This is meant to be installed in a **view** of the FLTR repo, not the repo itself. 

This package is dependent on the `crowdstrike/fltr-run` package. Please ensure the `crowdstrike/fltr-run` package is installed in the same view as this package.

## Dashboards

There is a selection of dashboards for getting quick value with FLTR. These may serve as the basis for building custom FLTR dashboards, alerts, and queries to match your specific use case.

This package provides a wide range of saved queries. These can all be customized or used as a reference point for building additional queries. 

## Event Interactions

Event interactions are included for both `aid` and `UserName` fields. This allows you to quickly pivot between the search and dashboard sections.
