      This package comprises logging and metrics dashboards for a Kubernetes cluster.
      It relies on logging and metrics as log events collected and forwarded by the fluent-bit log shipper:
      <https://fluentbit.io/>

      Dashboard searches assume the existence of static and dynamic log enrichments added the
      fluent-bit log shipper.
